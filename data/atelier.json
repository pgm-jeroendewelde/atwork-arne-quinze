After finishing its paint layer - which isn't only adding colour, but also adding durability - it will be transported to its final destination: a collector's garden. The Lupine flower has become Arne Quinze's symbol for his quest to challenge monocultures. We need diversity in our living environments, just like nature does in our wild environments. The amount of diversity found in an ecosystem is directly proportional to its resilience. Exactly the same applies to our society.",
